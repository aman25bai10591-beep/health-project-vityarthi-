Project Title:
Health Habit Tracker for Students (Python)

Motivation:
I made this small project because in college many students, even me also, do not really care about daily health routine. 
We sometimes sleep late, drink less water, no exercise and use phone for long time. 
So I wanted a simple way to write down daily health numbers and just see how I am doing.
It is not a big app. Just a basic tracker for practice and awareness.

Data Description:
The project stores the data in one file called "health_log.csv".
The file has these columns:
- date
- sleep_hours
- water_glasses
- exercise_minutes
- screen_hours
- health_score

The data is created by the program only. 
Whenever the user enters their daily details, the program saves it in the csv file.
The format of the file is simple comma separated values so it can open in Excel or any text editor.
The file is made automatically if it does not exist.

How to Use:
1. Install Python 3 on your system.
2. Download or clone this folder.
3. Open terminal / command prompt inside the project folder.
4. Run:  python app.py   (or python3 app.py if needed)
5. After running, a small menu will come.
   - Option 1: Add today record
   - Option 2: Show last 7 records summary
   - Option 3: Exit
The program also gives a health score and very small advice message.

License:
This is a simple college project only. Anyone can read or use the code for learning purpose.
No special license used. Please do not misuse the data.

Notes:
- This is NOT a medical project or accurate health measurement. It is just for basic habit tracking.
- The score formula is simple and made by me, not from any official source.
- The project uses Python topics like functions, loops, list, file handling, OOP class and exception handling.
- Folder structure should have app.py, the csv file (auto created), screenshots folder, recordings folder and this README.txt file.
- You can change the code logic according to your own idea if needed.
